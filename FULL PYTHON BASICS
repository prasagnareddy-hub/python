HI HELLO THERE! THANKS FOR CHOOSING THIS HUB AND I WHOLE HEARTLY WELCOME YOU (NEW BEGINNER) TO THIS TECHIE HUB.
#PYTHON SYNTAX:
print("welcome") #this is the final printing statement. no matter whatever you write final have to be excuted using this print statement.
if 5>2: # condition end with colon, in java almost each statement ends with semicolon don't be confused.
    print("yes it is")# wonder why is there a gap before??
    #that's because python uses indentation rather then flower brackets{} to indicate a block of code.AS indentation is used here the print statement comes under the condition.
else:
    print("nope")#if the if statement isn't true python excutes the else statement.Remeber always end conditions with colon or else python gives error.
        #EXCERCISE:
#WHAT IS PYTHON INDENTATION?
#PYTHON INDENTATION REFERS TO THE SPACES OR GAP AT THE BEGINNING OF A CODE.REMEMBER WITHOUT INDENTATION PYTHON GIVES ERROR. IT IS USED TO INDICATE A BLOCK OF CODE, IF THERE ARE MANY STATEMENTS UNDER THE SAME BLOCK THEN SAME NO.OF SPACES HAVE TO BE THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LINE.
#EXAMPLES:
if 6%2==0:
    print("It is factor of 6")
elif 6%2>0:
    print("It is not a factor")
else:
    print("not a number")
       #you can change the condition if according to your wish to execute a want statement. for suppose if u want else statement to be printed change this 6%2 anything that doesn't involve number.   
Program excercises:
#Fibannoic series:
n=0
m=1
N=int(input("No.of terms you want:"))
print(n,",",m,end="")
i=0
while i<=N:
    s=n+m
    print(",",s,end="")
    n=m
    m=s
    i+=1
#factors of N
N=int(input("'\n'Enter a number to find its factors:"))
i=1
while i<=N/2:
    if(N%i==0):
        print(i,"is a factor of given number")
    i+=1
#Digits of a given number:
N=23456
r=N%10
n=N//10
r2=n%10
N=n//10
r3=N%10
n=N//10
r4=n%10
N=n//10
r5=N%10
n=N//10
print(r,r2,r3,r4,r5)
print(*[r,r2,r3,r4,r5][::-1])
#whether the given number is prime or not:
n=int(input("check whether the number the is prime:\t"))
if n%2==0:
    print("yes given number is prime",n)
else:
    print("oops! not a prime number")
THE ABOVE are simple basic problem to prepare your mind to understand logic and sharpen its understanding.
